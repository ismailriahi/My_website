Hi, my name is Ismail. I am 22 years old and I was born and raised in Tunisia. Since my childhood I have always been passionate by Mathematics. At the same time, I also got really interested in economics and finance because I knew that these disciplines can have a huge impact in our lives, especially when trying to understand the underlying causes of the Tunisian revolution. I decided to pursue a bachelor’s in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics and Finance by love for the discipline but also because I knew that it would allow me to get the required quantitative skills to pursue a career in the financial industry. Throughout my degree, I gained numerous technical skills that I really wanted to apply to solve financial challenges. This has led me to an open a quantitative investment club. From there, I wanted to get more exposure to the financial industry specially in emerging markets and my internship at Riyada managers, a private equity firm investing in north Africa was the perfect match for me. This professional experience changed my vision about finance and has convinced me that financial institutions can find powerful solutions in response to global challenges, especially in sectors such as education and healthcare. And that’s why I hope that one day I will contribute to the development of my region by opening a private equity fund focused on north Africa when I will focus all my ressources to have a positive sustainable impact.
